Neural networks are a very popular data mining and image processing tool. Their origin stems from the attempt to model the human thought process as a an algorithm which can be efficiently run on a computer. The human brain consists of neurons that send activation signals to each other (figure on the left) thereby creating intelligent thoughts. The algorithmic version of a neural network (called an artificial neural network) also consists of neurons which send activation signals to one another (figure below). The end result is that the artificial neural network can approximate a function of multiple inputs and outputs. As a consequence, neural networks can be used for a variety of data mining tasks, among which are classification, descriptive modeling, clustering, function approximation, and time series prediction. Neural networks are also commonly used for image processing. Because the breadth of neural networks is very large, this project focuses on feed-forward neural networks, perhaps the most common type. Other popular types include radial basis function networks, self organizing maps, and recurrent neural networks. This page includes a description of feed-forward neural networks and the back-propagation learning algorithm, an overview of an implementation, several experiments of neural networks as classifiers on real and synthetic datasets, and a comparison between neural networks and some other classification algorithms.
