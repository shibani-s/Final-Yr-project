The problem of inducing general functions from specific training examples is central to learning. This chapter considers
concept learning: acquiring the definition of a general category given a sample of positive and negative training
examples of the category. Concept learning can be formulated as a problem of searching through a predefined space of
potential hypotheses for the hypothesis that best fits the train- ing examples. In many cases this search can be
efficiently organized by taking advantage of a naturally occurring structure over the hypothesis space-a general- to-
specific ordering of hypotheses. This chapter presents several learning algorithms and considers situations under which
they converge to the correct hypothesis. We also examine the nature of inductive learning and the justification by which
any program may successfully generalize beyond the observed training data.
